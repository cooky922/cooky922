## What I'm doing right now
* i've continuously molded the design of very infant language 'orange'
* i've been working on improvising my personal utility library `[gold++]`

## What I Like in C++
* there are infinite possibilities you can program
* i loved templates!

## What I Hate in C++
* frustrating at making big projects 
* I've been waiting for `std::format` and full support of modules in GCC.

## I've been forking some of the repositories :>

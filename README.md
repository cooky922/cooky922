## What I Like in C++
* Seems very easy to me.
* Data Structure and Algorithm are not my taste (currently).
* I loved templates!
* There are many things you could possibly do!

## What I Hate in C++
* Frustrating at making big projects 
* I've been waiting for `std::format` and full support of modules.

## My Favorite Source Code
```c++
template <std::integral T>
constexpr T fib(T n) {
    auto phi = std::numbers::phi_v<long double>;
    return std::round((std::pow(phi, n) - std::pow(-phi, -n)) / std::sqrt(5.0L));
}
```
